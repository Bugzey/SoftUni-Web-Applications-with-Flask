#	Lecture 4 TODO

##	Description
We employ schemas, schema validation, user sign ups and password hashing in order to create a
simple store app for clothes.

Strictly necessary:

* user object
* clothing item object
* user to clothing mapping

Improvement:

* have separate orders and associate orders with clothign items with users
* have separate colours and sizes tables
* associate clothes with available sizes and colours
* have users' clothes purchases be associated with sizes and colours


##	TODO-s

* [ ] Base app.py
* [ ] Alembic migration
* [ ] Models
* [ ] API resources
