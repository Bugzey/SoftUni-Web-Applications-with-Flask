Course description, plan and materials: [Softuni: Web Applications with Flask - June 2022]


##	Installation
TBD:

Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn,
NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a
novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people
to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a
particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be
installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection. 


##	Usage
TBD:

Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the
smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated
examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README. 


##	Contributing
TBD:

State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how
to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that
they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future
self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code
quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having
instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting
a Selenium server for testing in a browser.
